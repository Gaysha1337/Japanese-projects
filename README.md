# Japanese-projects
This is a repo for all my programming projects that will involve some use of the japanese language, either by learning it or improving it.This repo is aimed at people who enjoy programming and/or are learning japanese. More projects will be added to this repo, feel free to give any constructive feedback.

### Projects in this repo:
- Kanji Memory game

## Kanji Memory game:
***This game is still being developped, using only JS (Jquery), CSS and HTML***
This game's aim is to help with kanji recognition, by having the user match 2 cards of the same. This will need the player to memorize the kanji themselves and where they are on the board.
